# The Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy
We invite submissions to the 1st Workshop on The Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy (PRAXIS), co-located with the 19th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) that will take place virtually November 2-6, 2020. PRAXIS is a full-day workshop consisting of short presentations or reports on experiential teaching results, tool demonstrations and positioning, followed by break-out sessions. Due to the circumstances of these unprecedented times, we are particularly interested in identifying strategies and practices for both teaching and tools where virtual and online components have taken the forefront. All day Zoom calls have shown to be exhausting- what are workarounds that have been identified, especially with respect to our below topics?

The overarching purpose of this workshop is to start a community that is focused on the collection, development, and curation of pedagogical best practices, and the tools that support them, for the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph communities. More concretely, we wish to:

* Find effective ways to expand the expertise and knowledge of:
    * Developers already in industry
    * Domain experts
    * Students
* Improve the Developer Experience (DX)
* Establish the importance of Semantic Web technologies 
    * Incorporating them into a technology stack or workflow

Submissions should pertain to the topics below, with the intent to meet the goals specified above.

### Topics
* Academia x Pedagogy
    * Course Design
        * Materials (e.g. tutorials, exercises, references, lectures)
        * Format (e.g. MOOC, SCALE-UP)
* Academia x Tools
    * Design and efficacy of "teaching tools" 
    * What are and how can we make effective, usable tools?
* Industry x Pedagogy
    * Approachable knowledge graphs
        * “Semantic Web Technologies for the Masses”
        * Experiences and Anecdata
    * Seminar and Workshop Design
        * Tutorials, Skeletons
* Industry x Tools
    * Improving Developer Experience (DX)
    * Tool demos, emphasizing usability and approachability

### Programmme 
Due to the impact of COVID-19 and the virtual format, we have opted to make some small changes to the design and execution of PRAXIS 2020. 

* The workshop will be conducted virtually and synchronously.
* Reduced to 3 hours.
* Time and Date TBD, and dependent on timezone decision made by ISWC.
* The workshop will be conducted un-conference style (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference).
* The workshop will be hosted through Zoom and run through ISWC's infrastructure.
* Authors of submissions will be invited to give 5-10 minute lightning talks on their submission, and these submissions will act as seed topics for our un-conference.
* We intend to brainstorm and discuss tools and education along the dimensions outlined in the description.
* The results of our brainstorming and discussion, alongside submissions from our authors, will be placed into a GitHub repository and given a Zenodo DOI, per the Proceedings section, below.

### Submissions
* Abstracts (max 1 page / 500 words)
* Reports (max 4 pages)
    * Positioning
    * Implementation
    * Demonstrations
        - In particular, we are looking for the demonstration of tools that fill a gap. Specifically, how does the demonstrated tool assist in pedagogy (for industry or academia), or improve DX for building SWT. 
* Extended Abstracts and Material
    * Slides (max 2 slides per page)
    * Course Materials (e.g. syllabi, etc.)

Submissions should be formatted as either PDF or HTML and submitted to: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=praxis2020 

### Proceedings
Submissions will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. While we do not intend to publish through CEUR-WS, we will collect all accepted submissions and make them available on the workshop webpage. Further, we will register submissions through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) to provide a DOI.

### Important Dates
Submission deadline: August 17, 2020
Notification of Acceptance: September 11, 2020
Camera-ready version deadline: September 21, 2020
The workshop will be held on November 2 or 3, 2020
