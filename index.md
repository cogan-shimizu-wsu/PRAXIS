# The Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy
We invite submissions to the 1st Workshop on The Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy (PRAXIS), co-located with the 19th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) that will take place virtually November 2-6, 2020. PRAXIS is a full-day workshop consisting of short presentations or reports on experiential teaching results, tool demonstrations and positioning, followed by break-out sessions. Due to the circumstances of these unprecedented times, we are particularly interested in identifying strategies and practices for both teaching and tools where virtual and online components have taken the forefront. All day Zoom calls have shown to be exhausting- what are workarounds that have been identified, especially with respect to our below topics?

The overarching purpose of this workshop is to start a community that is focused on the collection, development, and curation of pedagogical best practices, and the tools that support them, for the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph communities. More concretely, we wish to:

* Find effective ways to expand the expertise and knowledge of:
    * Developers already in industry
    * Domain experts
    * Students
* Improve the Developer Experience (DX)
* Establish the importance of Semantic Web technologies 
    * Incorporating them into a technology stack or workflow

Submissions should pertain to the topics below, with the intent to meet the goals specified above.

### Topics
* Academia x Pedagogy
    * Course Design
        * Materials (e.g. tutorials, exercises, references, lectures)
        * Format (e.g. MOOC, SCALE-UP)
* Academia x Tools
    * Design and efficacy of "teaching tools" 
    * What are and how can we make effective, usable tools?
* Industry x Pedagogy
    * Approachable knowledge graphs
        * “Semantic Web Technologies for the Masses”
        * Experiences and Anecdata
    * Seminar and Workshop Design
        * Tutorials, Skeletons
* Industry x Tools
    * Improving Developer Experience (DX)
    * Tool demos, emphasizing usability and approachability

### Submissions
* Abstracts (max 1 page / 500 words)
* Reports (max 4 pages)
    * Positioning
    * Implementation
    * Demonstrations
        - In particular, we are looking for the demonstration of tools that fill a gap. Specifically, how does the demonstrated tool assist in pedagogy (for industry or academia), or improve DX for building SWT. 
* Extended Abstracts and Material
    * Slides (max 2 slides per page)
    * Course Materials (e.g. syllabi, etc.)

Submissions should be formatted as either PDF or HTML and submitted to: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=praxis2020 

### Proceedings
Submissions will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. While we do not intend to publish through CEUR-WS, we will collect all accepted submissions and make them available on the workshop webpage. Further, we will register submissions through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) to provide a DOI.
