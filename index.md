# The Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy
We invite submissions to the 1st Workshop on the Semantic Web in Practice: Tools and Pedagogy (PRAXIS) colocated with the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) that will take place in Athens, Greece from November 2nd to 6th, 2020. PRAXIS is a full-day workshop consisting of short presentations or reports on experiential teaching results, tool demonstrations, and positioning, followed by rigorous break-out sessions. Additional information can be found at www.praxis-workshop.com/ .

The overarching purpose of this workshop is to start a community that is focused on the collection, development, and curation of pedagogical best practices, and the tools that support them, for the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph communities. More concretely, we wish to:

* Find effective ways of expanding the expertise and knowledge of:
    * Developers already in industry
    * Domain experts
    * Students
* Improve the Developer Experience (DX)
* Establish the importance of Semantic Web technologies 
    * Incorporating them into a technology stack or workflow

Submissions should pertain to the topics below, with the intent to meet the goals, as above.

### Topics
* Academia x Pedagogy
    * Course Design
        * Materials (e.g. tutorials, exercises, references, lectures)
        * Format (e.g. MOOC, SCALE-UP)
* Academia x Tools
    * Design and efficacy of "teaching tools" 
    * What are and how can we make effective, usable tools?
* Industry x Pedagogy
    * Approachable knowledge graphs
        * “Semantic Web Technologies for the Masses”
        * Experiences and Anecdata
    * Seminar and Workshop Design
        * Tutorials, Skeletons
* Industry x Tools
    * Improving Developer Experience (DX)
    * Tool demos, emphasizing usability and approachability

### Submissions
* Abstracts (max 1 page / 500 words)
* Reports (max 4 pages)
    * Positioning
    * Implementation
    * Demonstrations
        - In particular, we are looking for the demonstration of tools that fill a gap. Specifically, how does the demonstrated tool assist in pedagogy (for industry or academia), or improve DX for building SWT. 
* Extended Abstracts and Material
    * Slides (max 2 slides per page)
    * Course Materials (e.g. syllabi, etc.)

Submissions should be formatted as either PDF or HTML and submitted to: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=praxis2020
